# Tatiane-2023-Ratiometric

## Purpose
I need to come up with a purpose.

## Workflow
1) Use CroppingMacro to divide 3x3 tiled images to separate images, or use TimepointMacro to split up timepoints into separate images.
2) Use AddC1toC3Macro to make combined 458-488 images for segmentation.
3) Use jupyter notebook in cellpose environment to make segmentation ROIs.
4) Use MeasuringMacro to measure 458, 488, and ratio intensities.
